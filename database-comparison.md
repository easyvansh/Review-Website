# Database Structure Comparison and Analysis

## Your Tentative Structure:

1. Database of All (ICE RINK/ COACH /CLUB):
   - Fields: Icon, Name, Title, Type, Review Count, Avg Rating, Info, Link

2. Database of Reviews:
   - Fields: Icon, Name (Level), Rating, Date, Review Text
   - Aggregation: Rating + Reviews = Avg

3. Database of Users:
   - Purpose: Login/SignUp, User Info, Add Review

## Analysis:

### Strengths:
1. Separation of concerns: You've correctly identified the need for separate databases for entities, reviews, and users.
2. Inclusion of essential fields: Your structure includes most of the necessary information for each entity.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. Relationship Management: In a NoSQL database like Firestore, managing relationships between entities can be challenging. The structure I proposed earlier uses references to link related data, which is more efficient in NoSQL databases.

2. Redundancy: Storing the average rating and review count in the entity database could lead to data inconsistencies. It's better to calculate these on-the-fly or update them using cloud functions when a new review is added.

3. Flexibility: Your structure might be less flexible when it comes to adding new types of entities or additional fields for specific entity types.

4. User Reviews: The connection between users and their reviews isn't clear in your structure.

5. Scalability: As your database grows, querying and filtering might become more challenging with this structure.

## How the Suggested Schema Addresses These Issues:

1. Uses a single 'entities' collection for all reviewable items, with a 'type' field to distinguish between them. This makes querying and filtering easier.

2. Separates reviews into their own collection, with references to both the user and the entity. This allows for easier management of user-review relationships.

3. Uses subcollections for reviews, which is more scalable in Firestore.

4. Provides flexibility for adding entity-specific fields through a separate 'additionalInfo' field.

5. Leverages Firestore's document-based structure for efficient querying and real-time updates.
